## Hi there 🤍
🖤 I am a software engineer in the making (well, an SWE intern at RedHat) with a passion for meaningful and useful projects.
<br><br>
🖤 My latest personal work has been *Helping Tiler*, a Gnome extension I had developed to simplify already existing overly complicated extensions and also working on my first embedded project just for fun.
<br><br>
🖤 I enjoy exploring various technologies, from web scraping in Python to JavaScript-based Google Docs extensions. I am also excited to delve more into embedded systems development using C or working in Go.
