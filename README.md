## Hi there! 🍂 
🐡 My name is Lena and I enjoy a good technical challenge!
<br><br>
🐇 I am currently working on my most complex project yet, **Helping Tiler** - an extension for Gnome.  It’s already fully functional and has been quite useful in my day to day life, though it’s still a work in progress with plenty of room for improvement.
<br><br>
🐙 In addition to that, I’m exploring a variety of smaller side projects. From web scraping in Python to creating Google Docs extensions in JavaScript, I enjoy experimenting with different technologies and learning through practical challenges (and JavaScript gives me plenty of those 🩵)
<br><br>
☁️ I am also interested in embedded software development and planning to start working on my first embedded project in C soon, since I miss working with lower level languages.
